       <h3>This graph illustrates the change in global CO2 emission rates over years</h3>
       <br>
       <p>
        Global CO2 emissions declined by 5.8% in 2020, or almost 2 Gt CO2 – the largest ever decline
         and almost five times greater than the 2009 decline that followed the global financial crisis.
          CO2 emissions fell further than energy demand in 2020 owing to the pandemic hitting demand for
           oil and coal harder than other energy sources while renewables increased. 

      <br>
      Despite the decline
      in 2020, global energy-related CO2 emissions remained at 31.5 Gt, which contributed to CO2 
      reaching its highest ever average annual concentration in the atmosphere of 412.5 parts per 
      million in 2020 – around 50% higher than when the industrial revolution began.

        <br><br>
       
      In 2021 global energy-related CO2 emissions are projected to rebound and grow by 4.8% as demand for
      coal, oil and gas rebounds with the economy. The increase of over 1 500 Mt CO2 would be the largest
       single increase since the carbon-intensive economic recovery from the global financial crisis more 
       than a decade ago, it leaves global emissions in 2021 around 400 Mt CO2, or 1.2%, below the 2019 peak.
