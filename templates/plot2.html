       <h3>This graph illustrates the change in global surface temperature</h3>
       <br>
<p>The world is getting warmer. Thermometer readings around the world have been rising since the 
  Industrial Revolution, and the causes are a blend of human activity and some natural variability—with
   the preponderance of evidence saying humans are mostly responsible.
<br>
  According to an ongoing temperature analysis conducted by scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for 
  Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by a little more than 1° 
  Celsius (2° Fahrenheit) since 1880. Two-thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of 
  roughly 0.15-0.20°C per decade.
  <br>
  The global temperature record represents an average over the entire surface of the planet. The temperatures 
  we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable cyclical events
   (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global 
   temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates
    back into space—quantities that change very little. The amount of energy radiated by the Earth depends
     significantly on the chemical composition of the atmosphere, particularly the amount of heat-trapping
      greenhouse gases.
