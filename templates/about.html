<p>
       Vehicle emissions affect local and regional air quality. Emissions generated from
       fuel combustion by internal combustion engines (ICE) include nitrogen oxides (NOx),
        hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter.  There are several chemicals released by combustion engines that are harmful to humans
       <br> 
       The air quality index (AQI) is an index for reporting air quality on a daily basis. It is a measure of how air pollution affects one's health within a short time period. The purpose of the AQI is to help people know how the local air quality impacts their health. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) calculates the AQI for five major air pollutants, for which national air quality standards have been established to safeguard public health.
       <br>
       1. Ground-level ozone
       <br>
       2. Particle pollution/particulate matter (PM2.5/pm 10)
       <br>
       3. Carbon Monoxide
       <br>
       4. Sulfur dioxide
       <br>
       5. Nitrogen dioxide
       <br>
       The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concerns.
        <br> The concept of AQI has been widely used in many developed countries for over the last three decades.
        <br>
         AQI quickly disseminates air quality information in real-time.

<p> Catalytic converters 
       are used to reduce the emissions from an internal combustion engine but carbon dioxide 
       (CO2), which is a greenhouse gas that is the main combustion product of carbon-based fuels.
        Vehicle CO2 emissions should be regulated around the world and should be reduced by
         improving the fuel efficiency of the vehicles. To control CO2 emission of vehicles 
         Fuel-efficient vehicles should be developed which use less gas to travel the same 
         distance as their less efficient counterparts. 

Our personal vehicles are a major cause of global warming.</p>
<p>For many years now, scientists and others have been raising concerns about 
    climate change and the potential consequences of the warming of the earth. 
    An excessive amount of carbon in the atmosphere contributes to global warming, 
    with carbon emissions from things such as factories and power plants being a major
     contributor to increased levels of atmospheric carbon. However, automobile emissions
      are another major source of carbon. They also increase pollution levels, which can
       lead to all manner of health problems. Understanding automobile carbon emission and
       what car owners can do to reduce it will go a long way toward addressing the aforementioned issues.
      Carbon emissions include a number of different chemicals and particulates
     that are produced when fuel is burned in an engine. Some of the major substances found 
     in a carâ€™s exhaust include carbon dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide. Other chemicals
      often found in exhaust gasses include benzene and nitrogen oxides. Many of these chemicals
       serve an important purpose in different parts of the atmosphere, but they can have bad
        consequences when human beings inhale them directly.</p>
